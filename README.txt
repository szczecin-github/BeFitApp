Hello Professor, I hope you will enjoy checking it out as much as I enjoyed making it. After creating the account, and checking the user side, use http://localhost:5000/Home/MakeMeAdmin to, make Yourself an Admin., you need to log out and in back *(couldn't figure it out how to make it apply instantly) you will get access to a new tab, admin tools, where you an create new workouts types and by yourself, change users passwords (working in Żabka Corp tought me that this feature is absolutly needed in projects like that). I hope you like it 
Have a good Day
